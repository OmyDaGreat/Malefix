/**
 * Bingu provides a centralized, declarative system for binding Xbox controller buttons to WPILib commands.
 *
 * This object is designed to simplify the process of mapping controller inputs to robot actions, supporting both
 * simple and complex command scheduling. It supports two binding styles:
 * - Deprecated vararg-based binding for legacy code.
 * - Modern DSL-based binding for clarity, flexibility, and maintainability.
 *
 * Usage:
 * 1. Use the DSL-based `bindings` extension for new code:
 *    ```kotlin
 *    controller.bindings {
 *        press(Button.A) { MyCommand() }
 *        release(Button.A) { MyReleaseCommand() }
 *    }
 *    ```
 * 2. The deprecated vararg-based method is supported for backward compatibility:
 *    ```kotlin
 *    controller.bindings(
 *        Bingu.bind(Button.A, { MyCommand() }, { MyReleaseCommand() })
 *    )
 *    ```
 *
 * Internally, Bingu tracks all bindings and schedules commands in its periodic loop. Each button can have a press and release command.
 * If a button is not explicitly bound, it defaults to an InstantCommand (does nothing).
 *
 * See the documentation for each function for more details and examples.

     * This list is used by the periodic loop to check button states and schedule commands.

     * You should not modify this list directly; use the provided binding functions.
