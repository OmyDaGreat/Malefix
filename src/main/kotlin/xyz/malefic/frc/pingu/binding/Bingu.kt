/**
 * [Bingu] provides a centralized, declarative system for binding [XboxController] buttons to WPILib [Command]s.
 *
 * This object is designed to simplify the process of mapping controller inputs to robot actions, supporting both
 * simple and complex command scheduling. It contains a modern DSL-based binding for clarity, flexibility, and maintainability.
 *
 * Usage:
 * * DSL-based [bindings] extension:
 *    ```kotlin
 *    controller.bindings {
 *      press(Button.A, MyCommand())
 *      release(Button.A, MyReleaseCommand())
 *      press(Button.B) { println("Pressed B!") }
 *      hold(Button.B) { println("Holding B!") }
 *    }
 *    ```
 *
 * Internally, [Bingu] tracks all bindings and schedules commands in its [periodic] loop. Each button can have a press, release, and hold command.
 * If a button is not explicitly bound, it defaults to an [InstantCommand] (does nothing).
 *
 * See the documentation for each function for more details and examples.
 */

     * This list is used by the [periodic] loop to check button states and schedule commands.
